# MS Word Add-In for Rephrasing Using a Fine-Tuned GPT-3 Model.

This Add-In for Microsoft Word is written to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model for rephrasing a selected sentence.  It returns the top two results.  Initially, the Curie engine was used, but this is more expensive.  The Ada engine produced inferior results, but the Babbage engine worked quite well.  

Please see the Jupyter Notebook for some guidance on training your own model.
